//The Browser Object Model (BOM) provides JavaScript access to the browser window and its components 
// beyond just manipulating the document displayed. 

// Key Differences b/w dom and bom:
// Purpose: BOM focuses on providing JavaScript access to browser-specific features and functionalities outside 
// the document content, whereas DOM focuses on representing the structure and content of HTML documents 
// for manipulation.

// Components: BOM includes objects like window, navigator, screen, location, and history for browser and environment
//  interaction. DOM includes objects like document, Element, Node, and Event for representing and manipulating 
// document structure and content.

// Manipulation Scope: BOM manipulates browser windows, navigation history, and screen properties. DOM manipulates 
// the structure, content, and styling of HTML documents displayed in the browser.
